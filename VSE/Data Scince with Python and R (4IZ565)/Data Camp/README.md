As part of my studies in VSE I took the "Data Science with Python and R" course and it came with subscription to the DataCamp learning platform where we
could complete the desired courses to better perform when it comes to inclass exercises. I used this opportunity to code more in Python (data science related tasks/courses) and uploaded the scripts here for reference.
