A desktop app that I developed using Python which allows the user to read the .xml files containing the valve signatures (pressure readings of the subsea valves that are used to assess the health of those valves) which were stored in a directory. The app extracts the necessary information from the file and plots it in a web browser. Having this software saved hours of engineering time and provided the them with a user friendly tool to ensure higher efficiency for reliability, maintainability and availability (RAM) processes.
